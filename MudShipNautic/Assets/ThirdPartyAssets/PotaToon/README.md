# POTA-TOON

![PotaToon](./Documentation/PotaToonImage_256.png)

POTA-Toon is an animation-style toon rendering asset designed for URP Forward(+) environments and PC/Console platforms. It supports lighting from multiple sources and detailed character shadows, ensuring natural illumination even in low directional light settings, such as concerts, by accurately detecting spotlights on characters.

Beyond lighting, POTA-Toon provides advanced rendering for complex transparent meshes, including realistic shadow support. Transparent shadows are available in all environments, while the OIT feature—designed for rendering intricate transparent meshes like dresses—is officially supported only on Windows devices (specifically DirectX 11 and 12).

Additionally, POTA-Toon includes dedicated post-processing for characters, allowing for localized color adjustments and bloom effects to enhance artistic expression.

- Supported Versions: 2021 LTS, 2022 LTS, 6.0 or later (RenderGraph-compatible from 6.0).
